  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: April 25, 2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy explains how the n8n TikTok Automation (“we,” “us,” “our” or “the Service”) collects, uses, discloses, and safeguards your information when you use our automated workflow to generate and upload TikTok content. By authorizing and using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information as described below.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>2.1 TikTok Account Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>OAuth Credentials:</strong> Access tokens and refresh tokens necessary to post and retrieve analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Profile Info:</strong> (username, user ID) to tag and track content uploads.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.2 Content Metrics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Views, Likes, Shares, Comments:</strong> Performance data on each generated video.</li>
    <li><strong>Engagement Trends:</strong> Aggregated statistics used to improve content generation algorithms.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.3 Usage & Device Data</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>IP Address & Timestamp:</strong> Logged when you interact with the Service for security and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li><strong>Workflow Logs:</strong> Non-personal logs of automation runs, errors, and status.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content Generation:</strong> Use engagement metrics to refine and personalize future video scripts and styles.</li>
    <li><strong>Analytics Dashboard:</strong> Present your TikTok performance in a simple interface.</li>
    <li><strong>Support & Maintenance:</strong> Diagnose issues, respond to inquiries, and monitor Service health.</li>
    <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Comply with TikTok’s API Terms of Service and applicable laws.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell, rent, or trade your personal data to third parties.</li>
    <li>Data may be shared with <strong>third-party providers</strong> (e.g., AI services, analytics platforms) under strict confidentiality and only to the extent necessary to operate the Service.</li>
    <li>We may disclose information if required by law or in response to lawful requests by public authorities.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>We retain your TikTok performance data and workflow logs for as long as your account remains active or as needed to comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion at any time (see Section 7).</p>

  <h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Access:</strong> You can view the data we hold about your activity via the Service dashboard.</li>
    <li><strong>Correction:</strong> Request updates or corrections to inaccurate data.</li>
    <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Ask us to delete your personal data—after which your analytics history will no longer be available.</li>
    <li><strong>Revocation:</strong> You may revoke TikTok OAuth access at any time; this does not delete data you’ve already generated unless you request it.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>7. Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard measures (encryption in transit, secure token storage) to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Use strong passwords and enable TikTok’s two-factor authentication for added safety.</p>

  <h2>8. Third-Party Links & Services</h2>
  <p>The Service may contain links to third-party websites or embed third-party tools. This Privacy Policy does not apply to those services. We encourage you to review their privacy notices before use.</p>

  <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>The Service is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from minors. If you become aware that a minor has provided us with information, please contact us to request deletion.</p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of material changes via email or in the Service interface. Continued use after changes indicates your acceptance.</p>

  <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions, requests, or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us at <strong>support@yourdomain.com</strong>.</p>

  <p><strong>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
